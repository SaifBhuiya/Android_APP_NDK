# Android_APP_NDK
This part is an extension of the app. I already had the app and all working systems. Now I needed to find a way to implement a different way to gather sensor data using (C++) and connect it with the app. I had never used C++ before and have always wanted to try it out and this was my opportunity to do it. Initially It was hard to understand how C++ and Java were communicating. Also I did not know how C++ would make sensor reading faster. After some research and trying out things I started understanding bits and pieces. There were multiple ways to do it, but I tried picking out the way which worked and wasnt too complex to grasp according to me. I setup an independent thread to continuously retrieve sensor data in c++ and store it. Whenever I needed the data I just sent the stored data to the required place. Once I found a way to retrieve sensor data through c++ and send it to Java the rest came naturally. The rest of the app was ready and I just had to implement this c++ section with it.
